Dog Walking in Maple Ridge BC

Welcome to Blue Moon Dog Walking!

We understand that your furry friends are an important part of your family. That's why we're here to provide reliable and professional dog walking services, giving you peace of mind while ensuring your dogs stay happy, healthy, and active.

### **Group Walks**

Group walks will take place in Maple Ridge on one of many nature trails and local parks. They are an excellent way for your pooch to play and socialize with other dogs, within the security of a safe and stable pack environment.

#### 1 hour walks  -  $35 Tax included

This one hour walk is for young pups, older ladies/gentlemants or breeds that don't need a big workout.

#### 1.5 hour walks  -  $40 tax included

This one and a half hour adventure walk is for the energetic dogs. Nature trail hikes, swimming, off leash (were available) and having fun with their besties.

Before beginning any dog walking service, I will schedule a complimentary meeting with you and your dog, which will take place at your home. I will ask about the dog's history, health and temperament, discuss your specific needs and schedule, as well as go over my pricing and policies.
